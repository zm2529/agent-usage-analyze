## Positioning Summary

Agent Analytics occupies the **developer self-reflection analytics** layer — it helps the *human developer* understand how they work with AI tools over time. This is distinct from tools that serve the *active AI agent* at runtime.

| Layer | What it does | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Agent runtime context** | Gives agents memory and continuity mid-task | Entire.io Skills, Claude Code memory |
| **Developer analytics** | Helps humans understand their AI usage patterns | **Agent Analytics** |
| **Session capture** | Records what happened during a session | Entire.io CLI, Claude Code JSONL |

Agent Analytics is neutral across runtimes (parses 5 providers), analytics-focused (friction taxonomy, pattern taxonomy, weekly reflect), and local-first. Competing tools are typically tied to a single runtime and focused on forward-looking agent continuity rather than backward-looking human learning.

## Entire.io Skills

**Open-sourced:** 2026-05-06
**GitHub:** https://github.com/entireio/skills
**Announced by:** Thomas Dohmke (CEO, Entire)

### What it does

Entire CLI captures rich context behind code changes: prompts, transcripts, and the decisions behind every commit. Their Skills system exposes this context to AI agents via four capabilities:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `session-handoff` | Picks up where another agent left off — reads saved/active session, summarizes task state, discoveries, blockers, and next steps |
| `explain` | Traces a function, file, or line back to the specific session that created it — answers "why does this code exist" (not just what it does) |
| `what-happened` | Combines git blame with Entire checkpoint context to explain why a specific block of code looks the way it does; useful during code review or regression investigation |
| `search` | Finds prior work in Entire history by topic, repo, branch, author, or time window — brings past context into the current task before making changes |

### Key differences from Agent Analytics

| Dimension | Entire.io Skills | Agent Analytics |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Primary consumer | The AI agent (runtime) | The human developer (analytics) |
| Time orientation | Present task continuity | Cross-session pattern aggregation |
| Source support | Entire CLI only | 5 providers (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI, VS Code Copilot Chat) |
| Output | Agent context window | Dashboard, CLI stats, `.agent-analytics.md` |
| Core question | "What was happening in this session?" | "How are my patterns changing over time?" |
| Freshness gate | None | `agent-analytics attach --check` (CI staleness gate) |
| Privacy model | Entire CLI captures + stores session data | Fully local SQLite, never leaves machine |

### Feature gaps this surfaces in Agent Analytics

**`explain`-equivalent (code → session attribution):** Entire.io can answer "which session created this function?" Agent Analytics has the raw data (tool calls with file edits in SQLite) but does not expose a code-location → session reverse lookup. This is a capability gap — noted for future consideration, but building it would pull Agent Analytics toward "agent infrastructure" rather than "developer analytics."

**`session-handoff`:** Out of scope. This is a runtime continuity concern — Claude Code's job, not Agent Analytics'.

**`what-happened`:** Partially covered by Agent Analytics' Key Decisions extraction in `.agent-analytics.md`, but at a higher abstraction level (architectural decisions across many sessions, not per-line blame context).

**`search`:** Phase 2 of the codebase knowledge feature (`agent-analytics context <topic>`) covers similar ground — querying past work by topic. Agent Analytics' version is aggregated and multi-source; Entire.io's is raw session retrieval tied to their CLI.

### Strategic notes

- Entire.io's open-sourcing **validates** the thesis that AI session data is valuable infrastructure.
- Their single-runtime constraint (tied to Entire CLI) leaves Agent Analytics' multi-source neutrality intact as the key moat.
- The `--check` CI staleness gate in `agent-analytics attach` has no equivalent in Entire.io or any comparable tool (as of 2026-05-06).
- Mention in README "Related projects" section. Positioning: "Entire builds the pipe; Agent Analytics builds the mirror."

## Claude Code Memory

Claude Code's built-in `CLAUDE.md` system serves as agent bootstrap context. Agent Analytics' `agent-analytics attach` generates and injects rules into `CLAUDE.md` via sentinels — making Agent Analytics a *source* for CLAUDE.md content rather than a competitor to it.

## Notes on Related Categories

**Session recording tools** (Replay, Jam, etc.): Web debugging focused, not AI session focused. Different category.

**Prompt optimization tools** (PromptLayer, Langfuse, etc.): Focus on LLM application developers instrumenting their apps, not individual developers analyzing their own AI tool usage. Different audience.

**AI coding analytics in IDEs** (Cursor's built-in stats, Copilot usage dashboard): Provider-specific, surface-level usage counts. No cross-tool aggregation, no pattern extraction, no reflection layer.
