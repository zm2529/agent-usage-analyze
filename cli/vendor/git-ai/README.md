Git AI is an open source git extension that tracks the AI-generated code in your repositories. After installing the extension, every line of AI code is linked to the **agent, model, and prompts** that generated it — so you never lose the intent, requirements, and architecture decisions behind your code.

**Just prompt and commit** — no workflow changes:

`git commit`

## Our Choices

- 🪄 **Transparent** — Git AI requires no workflow changes. Just prompt and commit as you normally would and Git AI automatically attaches attribution metadata to every commit. 
- ⚡ **No performance overhead** — Git AI does not rely on Git Hooks (slow + difficult to set up in every repo) and it does not wrap the Git binary. Your Git operations are just as fast as they were before Git AI was installed. 
- 💻 **Local-first** — Works offline, no login required.
- 🔒 **Secure Prompt Storage** — Git AI links each line of AI-code back to the prompt that generated it. These sessions are scanned and redacted, and saved outside of Git -- keeping repos lean, enabling fine-grained access control, and preventing PII or secrets from leaking. 
- 🌐 **Git native and open standard** — Git AI built the [open standard](https://github.com/git-ai-project/git-ai/blob/main/specs/git_ai_standard_v3.0.0.md) for tracking AI-generated code with Git Notes.

## Attribution Stats

Line-level AI-attribution let you track AI-code through the full SDLC. Track how much AI code gets accepted, committed, through code review, and into production — to identify which tools and practices work best.

```bash
git ai stats --json
git ai stats <start_sha>..<end_sha> --json
```

Calculates % AI-code, AI-lines generated vs committed, accepted rates, human overrides broken down by tool and model. Learn more: [Stats command reference docs](https://usegitai.com/docs/cli/reference#stats).

## AI Blame

Git AI blame is a drop-in replacement for `git blame` that shows AI attribution for each line. It supports [all standard `git blame` flags](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame).

```bash
git ai blame /src/log_fmt/authorship_log.rs
```

```bash
cb832b7 (Aidan Cunniffe 2025-12-13 08:16:29 -0500  136)     format: DiffFormat,
cb832b7 (Aidan Cunniffe 2025-12-13 08:16:29 -0500  137) ) -> Result<String, GitAiError> {
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  138)     // Resolve commits to get from/to SHAs
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  139)     let (from_commit, to_commit) = match spec {
fe2c4c8 (claude         2025-12-02 19:25:13 -0500  140)         DiffSpec::TwoCommit(start, end) => {

## FAQs

#### How does it work?

1. Coding Agents call `git-ai checkpoint` whenever they write code or modify files with bash scripts. 
1. On commit, Git AI stores line-level attribution data in Git Notes, linking each line of AI-generated code to the agent, model, and session that created it. Run `git log --show-notes="ai"` to see them. 
1. Git AI moves and merges line-level attributions when you `squash`, `merge`, `reset`, `rebase`, `stash`, `cherry-pick`, etc. so your AI code is always accurately tracked.

*Git AI does not use AI or heuristics to "detect" AI code — the Agents report exactly which lines they wrote, providing the most accurate, explicit attribution possible.*

#### Does the agent have to commit for Git AI to attribute the code?
No. Git AI works no matter how you commit — your Git client, the Git CLI, and your own Git aliases are all supported.

#### Git AI notes are attached to commits — how are attributions preserved when I rebase, squash, stash, cherry-pick, etc.?
Git AI analyzes the final state of the code after the operation completes and copies/merges the attributions into a Git Note for any completed commits. It's eventually consistent. The note will be written 5-100ms after the operation completes.

#### Can I use this on my own?
Yes. Git AI is free and open source, works locally, and requires no login or team setup.

#### Is there a performance impact?
No. Git AI does not use Git hooks and it does not wrap Git, so you won't see any overhead on your Git commands.

#### Do I have to set up agent hooks?
Nope — Git AI manages the agent hooks and checks/updates them daily. If you want to trigger this yourself (ie just installed a new agent) run `git ai install-hooks`.

#### Who uses this?
Hundreds of engineering teams (including many in the Fortune 100) use Git AI to understand their AI usage and make agents more effective on their codebase.

#### What's the difference between the open source CLI and the [teams version](https://usegitai.com)?
The CLI accurately attributes AI code on every commit. The teams version adds a secure prompt store and joins in data from across the SDLC — tying token spend to individual Pull Requests, calculating % AI by PR, team, and repo, and connecting signals like amount of rework during code review, and even tying incidents back to the AI session that caused them. Self-host it or run it in our cloud: connect your SCM and get aggregate stats across thousands of repos plus full observability into everything your coding agents do.

#### Who built this?
[Aidan](https://github.com/acunniffe) and [Sasha](https://github.com/svarlamov) — say hi in [Discord](https://discord.gg/XJStYvkb5U) or set up a [Meet the maintainers call](https://calendly.com/d/cxjh-z79-ktm/meeting-with-git-ai-authors).

#### What are the capabilities and known limitations?
Git AI provides line-level attribution for AI-generated code - whether it is written with an edit tool or a bash command. When a Git rewrite operation is run (`rebase`, `stash`, `squash --merge`, etc) Git AI will move and merge attributions so nothing is lost. 

Here is a full breakdown of what is supported today:
