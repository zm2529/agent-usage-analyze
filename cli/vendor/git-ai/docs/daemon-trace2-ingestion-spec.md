# Daemon Trace2 Ingestion Spec

Status: authoritative spec for how the git-ai daemon establishes exact
ownership of git ref transitions from trace2 event streams. Companion docs:

- `docs/rewrite-ops-spec.md` — what happens once exact transitions are known.
- `docs/attribution-fuzzer-spec.md` — correctness pressure.

## The problem: exact command ownership

The daemon learns about git commands asynchronously: git writes trace2 events
to a socket, the daemon reads them later. Git mutates refs synchronously
inside the git process. By the time the daemon processes a command, the repo
may have moved on — more commands, user edits, other worktrees.

Stock trace2 does not include created commit SHAs or complete ref-update OIDs
for most commands. A delayed trace2 root saying "git commit ran in repo X
with argv Y, exit 0" identifies *that a command ran*, not *which reflog
entries it produced*. Attribution requires the latter.

**Ownership rule.** A ref-moving command's transitions are exact if and only
if at least one of:

1. **Pre-command cursor** — the daemon held a reflog cursor (byte offset +
   anchor) for the relevant ref from *before* the command; entries appended
   after the cursor, matching the command's expected transition shape, belong
   to it.
2. **Immutable argv OIDs** — the command line itself contains full OIDs
   sufficient to identify the operation (e.g. `merge --squash <sha>`,
   `update-ref ref <new> <old>`, `cherry-pick <sha1> <sha2>`).

Otherwise the command is **not exact**: the daemon must fail closed for
attribution (no guessed authorship, no note migration) and may only use the
command as a *future baseline* — observe the current reflog ends so the *next*
command is exact.

Banned as ownership proof (each was tried and failed; see Postmortem):
reflog timestamps (seconds-resolution, not causally tied to a trace2 root),
commit/reflog message matching (messages collide), latest-HEAD guessing, and
daemon-ingress "start" offsets captured after the fact.

## Data path

```
git (trace2 socket target)
  → socket listener (src/daemon.rs)
      prepare_trace_payload_for_ingest: filters definitely-read-only roots,
      enqueues mutating roots with sequence numbers
  → TraceNormalizer (src/daemon/trace_normalizer.rs)
      groups frames by root sid; terminal event → NormalizedCommand
  → coordinator → family actor (one actor per repo family = common git dir)
      owns ordered state for the family, including the RefCursor
  → RefCursor::enrich_command (src/daemon/ref_cursor.rs)
      consumes cursor-bounded reflog entries → cmd.ref_changes
  → analyzers (src/daemon/analyzers/history.rs)
      classified semantic events → rewrite/post-commit side effects
```

Separation of concerns:

- The **normalizer** parses trace2/argv facts only. It never reads mutable
  repo state to synthesize missing command facts.
- The **family actor** owns all ordered, stateful reasoning: the ref cursor,
  the stash stack, pending operation state. Commands and checkpoints for one
  repo family are processed in arrival order.
- **Side effects** run only after enrichment, on exact data.

### NormalizedCommand

Facts: family/scope, worktree, root sid, raw argv, primary command, observed
child commands, exit code, trace start/finish timestamps, optional
`reflog_start_offsets`, operation-specific immutable OIDs from argv
(stash target, cherry-pick sources, revert sources), `ref_changes` (output of
enrichment), confidence.

`reflog_start_offsets` carries *claimed* command-start reflog positions.
Trust is decided at the cursor, not at ingress (see below).

## Ref cursor model

Per family, the cursor stores per-ref-key:

- byte offset into the reflog file (always at a line boundary)
- anchor: the full reflog record ending at that offset (old/new OIDs,
  message) proving the offset still belongs to the same reflog generation
- consumed offsets/anchors (entries already owned by earlier commands)
- in-memory stash stack and pending cherry-pick source OIDs

Ref keys distinguish `worktree:<git_dir>:HEAD` (per-worktree HEAD reflogs)
from `common:<ref>` (shared refs like `refs/heads/main`, `refs/stash`).

Robustness requirements (all implemented and tested):

- incomplete trailing reflog lines are ignored (a writer may be mid-append)
- a saved offset is honored only if it lands on a newline and its anchor
  matches the record ending there; otherwise the cursor is cleared
- offset beyond file length (pruned/truncated reflog) clears the cursor
- branch delete/recreate clears the stale cursor
- expiry/`reflog expire` invalidates via anchor mismatch

### Consumption

`enrich_command` consumes reflog entries appended after the cursor that match
the command's *expected transition shape* — per-command message-prefix
families (`commit`, `commit (amend):`, `rebase`, `reset:`, `checkout:`, ...)
and expected old/new OID constraints derived from family state and argv.
Matched entries move into the consumed set so the next command cannot claim
them. Multi-entry operations (rebase, multi-pick) consume contiguous spans
where each entry's `old` equals the previous entry's `new`. Message prefixes
and timestamps may *narrow* an already-exact candidate set; they are never
the proof of ownership by themselves.

If nothing matches: `ref_changes` stays empty, confidence stays low, side
effects skip attribution (fail closed), and the cursor advances to the
current reflog end as a baseline for future commands only.

### Seeding

Cursors come into existence at trusted observation points:

1. **Trace ingress capture** (best-effort): when the daemon sees a *live*,
   non-terminal trace2 frame for a mutating command, it captures current
   reflog ends and attaches them to the root as claimed start offsets. Because
   delivery is asynchronous, these claims may already be post-append;
   `command_start_offset_is_authoritative` only accepts a claimed offset if
   records exist after it and it does not move an existing cursor backward.
   An accepted-but-late offset can only shrink the window a command may claim
   (it can lose attribution, never steal another command's entries) — late
   capture is *conservative*, satisfying fail-closed.
2. **Checkpoints**: a checkpoint arriving at the family actor is a real,
   ordered causal observation; processing it establishes family state (and
   hence expected-transition inputs) for subsequent commands.
3. **Command completion**: after any command is processed — resolved or not —
   the cursor observes the current reflog ends as the baseline for the next
   command.

### Cold start

"Cold" = the repo was set up without trace2 (or before the daemon existed),
so no cursor predates the first traced command.

- The first traced command must process without crash, deadlock, or state
  poisoning.
- If it lacks immutable argv OIDs and no cursor existed, it fails closed for
  attribution and seeds the baseline.
- Subsequent commands are exact.
- Special case: first traced command whose argv contains sufficient immutable
  OIDs (e.g. `merge --squash <sha>`) is exact even cold.

## Operation-specific ownership notes

- **commit / amend**: expected HEAD transition with `commit`/`commit (amend):`
  message family; branch ref entry consumed alongside HEAD when they describe
  the same transition.
- **rebase**: consumes the contiguous HEAD span from original tip through
  final tip; `rebase --continue` of an in-progress rebase relies on
  family-actor pending state from the failed command's consumed prefix, never
  on reading `.git/rebase-merge` after the fact.
- **cherry-pick / revert**: source OIDs from argv when immutable; symbolic
  sources resolved only at a cursor-bounded boundary; pending source state
  carries across conflicted stop/continue.
- **stash**: the in-memory stash stack mirrors `refs/stash` mutations observed
  through consumed entries; `stash@{N}` resolves against that stack, not
  against the live ref at processing time.
- **reset**: `reset:` message family, old-OID constraint relaxed (reset can
  move from any state); backward-reset detection happens downstream from the
  exact transition.
- **update-ref**: argv carries ref name and usually both OIDs (immutable);
  used by graphite-style restacks (`commit-tree` + `update-ref`). Multiple
  same-command ref updates are correlated by OID first, with the command's
  time window only narrowing candidates.
- **pull**: decomposes into fetch + merge/rebase; ownership follows the
  underlying HEAD/branch transitions.
- **merge-tree / commit-tree alone**: create objects, move no refs — no
  transition to own; nothing happens until a ref moves.
- **push / fetch / clone**: notes-sync side effects keyed off argv remotes;
  missing `refs/notes/ai` is a no-op, not an error.

## Reads must not sync

Production read commands (`show`, `blame`, `status`, ...) must not trigger a
hidden daemon sync or barrier. Tests use explicit sync immediately before
assertions; a barrier in production would hide races instead of fixing them
and cannot create missing command-start data anyway.

## Postmortem: rejected approaches

These were implemented, found unsound, and removed. Do not reintroduce.

1. **mtime-guarded worktree snapshots** (post-commit carryover): read the live
   worktree after git exited, guarded by `mtime <= git_finish_time`.
   Filesystem clocks are coarse; later writes land in the same quantum; the
   snapshot can capture the *next* operation's content. Replaced by persisted
   working logs + committed tree data.
2. **Live-worktree stash restore**: same race, same fix — reconstruct from
   stash objects + target head in isolation.
3. **Daemon-ingress offsets as proof**: a captured "start" offset may actually
   be post-command. Demoted from proof to conservative, validated hint (see
   Seeding); never primary evidence.
4. **Trace2 barrier / hidden read sync**: hides races; doesn't create data.
5. **Reflog timestamp matching as proof**: seconds-resolution, collides;
   allowed only to narrow already-exact candidate sets.
6. **Message matching without a cursor**: duplicate commit messages are
   ubiquitous; cold duplicate-message commands fail closed instead.

## Test obligations

Deterministic tests must cover, at minimum:

1. delayed duplicate-message commits without a cursor fail closed
2. checkpoint-then-commit attributes exactly
3. cold first traced commit does not guess; seeds baseline only
4. partial trailing reflog line ignored; partial and full prune clear cursor
5. branch delete/recreate clears cursor state
6. symbolic ref movement after a delayed command does not corrupt attribution
7. immutable argv OIDs work cold (squash, cherry-pick, update-ref)
8. live worktree edits after commit/stash-pop do not leak into attribution
9. symlink/canonical path variants map to one repo family
10. no hidden sync before `show`/`blame`
11. daemon survives partial trace roots, socket close ordering, child trace
    traffic, and never deadlocks checkpoints behind unidentified sockets

Primary suites: `tests/daemon_mode.rs`, `tests/commit_tree_update_ref.rs`,
`tests/integration/rewrite_ops_attribution.rs`, ref-cursor unit tests in
`src/daemon/ref_cursor.rs`.

## Bottom line

Exactness is structural, not heuristic: cursor, or immutable argv OIDs, or
fail closed. The unavoidable consequence — git-ai cannot attribute the very
first delayed write command in a cold repo from stock trace2 alone — is
missing information, not a bug. Every mechanism that tried to paper over that
gap (timestamps, messages, latest-state guesses, post-hoc offsets) produced
misattribution and was removed.
