Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **pnpm** >= 9

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/melagiri/agent-analytics.git
cd agent-analytics

# Install dependencies (workspace root)
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Link CLI for local testing
cd cli && npm link
```

```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or: fix/description, chore/description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/*` — New features
- `fix/*` — Bug fixes
- `chore/*` — Maintenance, dependencies, config

### 2. Make changes

```bash
# Watch mode for the CLI
cd cli && pnpm dev

# Watch mode for the dashboard
cd dashboard && pnpm dev

# Watch mode for the server
cd server && pnpm dev
```

### 3. Verify your changes

```bash
# From the workspace root — builds all 3 packages
pnpm build
```

### 4. Test locally

```bash
# Primary testing path — syncs sessions and opens the dashboard
agent-analytics

# Test individual commands
agent-analytics sync --dry-run
agent-analytics stats
agent-analytics dashboard
```

### 5. Submit a PR

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Write a clear description of what changed and why
- Reference any related issues

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **ES Modules** (`import`/`export`, not `require`)
- Match the existing style in surrounding code
- Use `chalk` for colored terminal output, `ora` for spinners

## What to Work On

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/melagiri/agent-analytics/issues) for bugs and feature requests
- Issues labeled `good first issue` are a great starting point
- If you want to work on something not listed, open an issue first to discuss

## Reporting Bugs

When filing a bug report, include:

1. What you expected to happen
2. What actually happened
3. Steps to reproduce
4. Node.js version (`node --version`)
5. OS and version

## Suggesting Features

Open an issue with:

1. The problem you're trying to solve
2. Your proposed solution
3. Any alternatives you considered

```
